# 431 Quizzes Main Page

This is the main page for our three Quizzes in 431, Section 1 for Fall 2018. 

All Quizzes are taken online, at home, requiring a connection to the Internet, and access to R and R Studio, and consist of a mix of multiple-choice and short answer questions. The tests are open book and open notes.

You will have at least three days to do each quiz, and you can use as much (or as little) of that time as you like. My expectation is that the middle half of you (or more) will take 3-6 hours to do each Quiz, but some people will certainly take longer, and some won't need that long. You will also be able to complete it in multiple sittings by submitting your partial work, and then editing your submission. The software will automatically send you a link to edit your work after you make a submission.

The Quizzes are Google Forms (so if you can do a Minute Paper, that's the process for the Quiz) and each item requires a brief response. You won't be writing essays on Quizzes, and you won't be presenting answers that consist of more than a short amount of code. Some items will require you to analyze some data in R to get to an answer. Some items will require you to look at provided R output to get to an answer. Some items will not involve R at all. 

At the end of each quiz, you will have to indicate that you did not receive any help on the Quiz from any other human being besides Dr. Love and the Teaching Assistants, who will only clarify things, not provide you with answers. Discussing the Quiz with any other human (including other students in the class) is not permitted.

There are enough items on every Quiz that a perfect score is rare. A score of 85% or higher on a Quiz is usually regarded as the minimum for an A, and a score of 70% or higher is usually the minimum for a B, although I reserve the right to change my mind about that if the results of the Quiz do not meet our expectations.

Books we are reading: 

- **Silver** - this is *The Signal and the Noise* by Nate Silver, which you need to [purchase for this course](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/index.html#what-do-i-need-to-buy). Some chapters are going to feel more relevant to you than others, and that's fine.
- **Leek** - this is *The Elements of Data Analytic Style* by Jeff Leek, which you must also [purchase](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/index.html#what-do-i-need-to-buy). The book is short, and I encourage you to simply read it, as soon as possible (it won't take more than a couple of hours), then refer to it later in the term as specific issues arise.
- **R4DS** - this is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This semester, we'll focus on the Explore (Section I) and Communicate (Section V) materials, mostly, with some additional pieces from the other parts of the book.
