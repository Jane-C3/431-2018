# 431 Homework Information, Fall 2018

Each assignment requires you to analyze some data, and prepare a report using R Markdown. Sometimes you will also need to write a short essay, for which you also need to use R Markdown, and not, for instance, a Word document. 

## Schedule

There are 8 planned homework assignments.

## Logistics

You will turn in your Homework using the Canvas system at https://canvas.case.edu. You will submit both your Markdown file, and an HTML document built from that R Markdown file through Canvas. Our preference in 431 is an HTML submission, even though it is possible to generate Word or PDF versions, as well. 

- The courseâ€™s primary listing on Canvas is PQHS 431, but students in CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 should find the same information. 
- The Canvas link to post your responses for each new Homework assignment will appear a day or two after the deadline for the preceding assignment has passed.

## Using a new Project for Each Homework

Your life will be far happier if you use an R Project every time you open R to do work. Just start your R Studio session with File ... New Project or File ... Open Project, as appropriate. We recommend that you use a separate R project for each homework.

## A Template for Homework Assignments

For the first two homeworks, we have provided a template (a different template for each assignment) that will help you produce your response. These are described in the instructions for those two homeworks. You'll find the actual templates on the [Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data).

## Grading Errors? Regrade Requests? Here's the form!

As the semester progresses, you may find an error in homework grading that you would like Dr. Love to review. You would do this by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/G4ZZ1Fge1ZkQVKzy2) before **noon on 2018-12-13**. Note that you'll need to log into Google via CWRU to see the form. See the last section of the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/) for more details.

## Tips on Homework Submission

1. Submit HTML and R Markdown, without zipping the files together.
2. Use complete sentences, and proper English grammar, syntax and spelling. To use R Studio's spell-checker, hit F7.
3. Avoid printing things we don't need to see (like data frames) to judge your work.
4. Place empty lines before and after each code chunk.
5. Name every chunk, with no characters other than letters, numbers and underscores. No repetition!
6. Use headings to indicate the question being solved. Then leave a blank line before continuing with text.
7. Avoid repeating Dr. Love's questions verbatim.
8. We encourage you to edit your code ruthlessly, and submit only the pieces you actually want us to review.
9. The most important thing you should do before submitting your work is read over the HTML and see that it includes what you mean it to include, and that (for instance) axis labels show up properly, etc. and that various "false starts" don't turn up in the final result.

More details are available in the individual assignments, and in the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/), specifically in the [General Writing and Presenting tips section](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/a-few-general-writingpresenting-tips.html).

## On getting help.

Apply the 15-minute rule.
    - If you can't solve a problem in 15 minutes, ask for help.
    - You are **absolutely supposed** to use Google and the TAs (and Dr. Love) to improve your code.
