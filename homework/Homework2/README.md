# 431 Homework 2 Main Page

Homework 2 is due at noon on Friday 2018-09-14. It contains eleven questions.

- Homework 2 [instructions are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework2/431-2018-hw2.md).

Any assignment received more than 60 minutes after the deadline is considered late. **Don't be late.**

## The answer sketch is now available.

- [This is the PDF link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework2/431-2018-hw2sketch.pdf) and [this is the R Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/homework/Homework2/431-2018-hw2sketch.Rmd). 

## Grades on Homework 2 are now available

- You'll find them in the Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades. Look for the Homework 2 Tab, and you'll need your 3-digit Homework Code for the semester, which Professor Love emailed to you on 2018-09-13. 
- You will also probably want to look at [the grading rubric](http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw2-rubric) at http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw2-rubric.
- HW2 grades are out of 115 points, but we will treat this as a 100 point Homework at the end of the term, so if you scored higher than 100, that will just be a bonus.  At the end of the term, we add up your scores on the 8 homework assignments, and divide by 800 to determine your homework grade. All Homeworks are thus treated as if they are worth 100 points, even though on some of them, like HW 2, it was possible to score higher than that. If your total at the end of the term is above 800 (and this has happened), you will receive a Homework grade of 100%.

## Steps to a Successful Homework

Here are the steps I would take to do the homework, after I read [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework2/431-2018-hw2.md).

1. Create a new directory called something like `431HW2`, specifically for this homework assignment.
2. Use the **YOURNAME-hw2.Rmd** file to get started. You'll find it at the [Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data). Download a zip file (by clicking on the green Clone or Download button) of all needed materials, then unzip the file, and copy the **YOURNAME-hw2.Rmd** file to the `431HW2` directory you have created. Note that this is NOT the same thing as the HW 1 template.
3. Open R Studio, and create a new R Project in this existing `431HW2` directory. 
4. Edit the R Markdown file in R Studio to get what you want, and then be sure to save it using your actual name in the file name.
5. Knit the file in R Studio to create an HTML file, which should have your actual name in it, not `YOURNAME-hw2.html`
6. Review the HTML file closely, and make changes to the R Markdown file and re-knit until you are satisfied.
7. Submit your final R Markdown file and your final HTML file to us via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), by the deadline, which again is noon Friday 2018-09-14.

## General Tips on Homework Submission

1. Submit HTML and R Markdown, without zipping the files together.
2. Use complete sentences, and proper English grammar, syntax and spelling. To use R Studio's spell-checker, hit F7.
3. Avoid printing things we don't need to see (like data frames) to judge your work.
4. Place empty lines before and after each code chunk.
5. Name every chunk, with no characters other than letters, numbers and underscores. No repetition!
6. Use headings to indicate the question being solved. Then leave a blank line before continuing with text.
7. Avoid repeating Dr. Love's questions verbatim.
8. When available, use the template, don't fight it.

# Material to Come
