- Thursday, once the homework is graded, we'll post details on how you can get your grade on the assignment.

## Steps to a Successful Homework

Here are the steps I would take to do the homework, after I read [the instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework1/431-2018-hw1.md).

1. Create a new directory called something like `431HW1`, specifically for this homework assignment.
2. Use the **YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd** file to get started. You'll find it at the [Data and Code page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data). Download a zip file (by clicking on the green Clone or Download button) of all needed materials, then unzip the file, and copy the YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd file to the `431HW1` directory you have created.
3. Open R Studio, and create a new R Project in this existing `431HW1` directory. 
4. Edit the R Markdown file in R Studio to get what you want, and then be sure to save it using your actual name in the file name.
5. Knit the file in R Studio to create an HTML file, which should have your actual name in it, not `YOURNAME-hw1.html`
6. Review the HTML file closely, and make changes to the R Markdown file and re-knit until you are satisfied.
7. Submit your final R Markdown file and your final HTML file to us via [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu), by the deadline, which again is noon Friday 2018-09-07.

## General Tips on Homework Submission

1. Submit HTML and R Markdown, without zipping the files together.
2. Use complete sentences, and proper English grammar, syntax and spelling. To use R Studio's spell-checker, hit F7.
3. Avoid printing things we don't need to see (like data frames) to judge your work.
4. Place empty lines before and after each code chunk.
5. Name every chunk, with no characters other than letters, numbers and underscores. No repetition!
6. Use headings to indicate the question being solved. Then leave a blank line before continuing with text.
7. Avoid repeating Dr. Love's questions verbatim.
8. When available, use the template, don't fight it.
