431 is also supported by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), a terrific learning platform for data science, and you'll get more details on that in the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/datacamp.html). On 2018-08-30, I sent you an invitation to join us in that community. Please do.

## What Should I do before the First Class?

There is no pre-class assignment. If you're looking to get a jump on things:

1. Read the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/).
2. Order or obtain [the two required books](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/index.html#what-do-i-need-to-buy) (combined cost: about $25).
3. [Install the (free) software we'll use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software) on your computer. 

That's most of your assignment for the start of Class 2, on 2018-08-30.
