## Today's Materials

- Class 13 audio files are now posted above.

## Quiz 1 discussion

- You should have received at least one email from me (and perhaps two) about the Quiz. I sent them between 9:30 and 11 this morning.
- The answer sketch [is posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/quizzes/quiz01/431-2018-quiz01.pdf).
- For most people, grades are posted as part of the Homework grades sheet at http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades. The exceptions include people at both the top and the bottom of the class in terms of Quiz performance, who received their grades via email from me.
- We'll discuss a few key points in class briefly today, working through some parts of the [Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/quizzes/quiz01/431-2018-quiz01.pdf).
- If you have questions about the quiz's content, ask them at 431-help.
- If you have questions about the quiz's grading, contact Dr. Love directly.

## Data Sets for Project Task A

Some of you have discovered the `nhanesA` package in R. If you want to use `nhanesA`, you will need to combine data from at least two (and ideally more than two) different forms within that package, and you'd need to generate a meaningful and interesting research question using that combination of forms that is unlike every other student who is trying to use that package. 

## Demonstration Projects

- I've begun to post the Project Demonstration for Study 1 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1. This is a demonstration of what we'll be looking for in your end-of-semester portfolio in Task G. 
    - We will make both HTML and R Markdown versions of the Study 1 demonstration available to you as soon as possible. We took down the old versions because they weren't executing properly.
- When that's done, I'll post the Project Demonstration for Study 2 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study2, which will also describe what we want to see in the portfolio (Task G).

## Low-Stakes Visualization of the Day

[How Good is "Good"?](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2018/10/02/how-good-good/?utm_source=website_article&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=word_sentiment) from Matthew Smith at YouGov.

## High-Stakes Visualization of the Day

You can easily get lost in [the Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), a fantastic new resource on social mobility data, developed by Raj Chetty, John Friedman, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie Jones and Sonya Porter. 

- David Leonhardt wrote an excellent Opinion piece on the Atlas on 2018-10-04 entitled "[A One-Question Quiz on the Poverty Trap](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/opinion/child-poverty-family-income-neighborhood.html)" which links to other key pieces, including the original study.
    - The money quote here is... "I want to ask you to take a minute and try to guess: Which economic and social indicators do you think were the strongest predictors of the life outcomes of a neighborhood’s children?"
    - If you read the piece, you'll learn that (after mean household income) the next largest correlation is ...
        - a neighborhood's share of single-parent households. 
        - "All else being equal — income, race, educational outcomes — children who grow up in neighborhoods with fewer two-parent families fare notably worse."
- There's also a more traditional NY Times story by Emily Badger and Quoctrung Bui on 2018-10-01 entitled "[Detailed New National Maps Show How Neighborhoods Shape Children for Life](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/upshot/maps-neighborhoods-shape-child-poverty.html?module=inline)" which allows you to interact with excerpts from the Atlas, and which connects you directly to your current location.
    - A money quote from that piece: "Nationwide, the variation is striking. Children raised in poor families in some neighborhoods of Memphis went on to make just $16,000 a year in their adult households; children from families of similar means living in parts of the Minneapolis suburbs ended up making four times as much."
