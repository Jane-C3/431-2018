```

## Today's R Starting Point

```{r packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Western Collaborative Group Study (`wcgs`)

See Notes, Chapter 13. 

- Full data set has 3,154 observations on 22 variables.

```{r}
wcgs <- read.csv("wcgs.csv") %>% tbl_df()
```

# Using the key verbs in `dplyr`

## `dplyr` basics: The Key Verbs

Six key functions:

- Pick observations by their values (`filter()`).
- Reorder the rows (`arrange()`).
- Pick variables by their names (`select()`).
- Collapse many values down to a single summary (`summarise()`).
- Create new variables with functions of existing variables (`mutate()`).
- Change the scope of another function from operating on the whole data set to operating on it group-by-group (`group_by()`)

> All of this comes from the Explore section of Grolemund and Wickham's *R for Data Science*, in particular the material on Data transformation.

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html

## `dplyr` basics: How the verbs work

- The first argument is a data frame (or tibble).
- The second arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using `$`.
- The result is a new data frame.

## Filter rows with `filter()`

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values.

```{r filter wcgs to get those with}
wcgs.sub1 <- wcgs %>%
  filter(dibpat == "Type A" & age > 49)
wcgs.sub1
```

## Comparison and Logical Operators

Comparison Operator | Meaning
-------------------:| ---------------
`>` | is greater than
`>=` | is greater than or equal to
`<` | is less than
`<=` | is less than or equal to
`!=` | is not equal to
`==` | is equal to

Logical (Boolean) Operator | Meaning
-------------------:| ---------------
`&` | and
`|` | or
`!` | not

Missing Values (`NA` in R) can make things tricky. They are contagious. Almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown.

## The complete set of Boolean Operators

```{r boolean-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/boolean.png")
```

Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators

## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

`arrange()`, instead of selecting rows (like `filter()`), changes their order. 

- Use `arrange(height)` to arrange in ascending order of height. Provide a second column name to break ties, if you like. 
- Missing values are always sorted at the end.

```{r arrange wcgs by height and then weight}
wcgs %>%
  arrange(desc(height), desc(weight))
```

## Select columns with `select()`

`select()` lets you zoom in on the columns you actually want to use based on the names of the variables. [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#select-columns-with-select) lays out some helper functions within select() for use in bigger data sets. 

```{r select columns from wcgs of interest}
wcgs.sub2 <- wcgs %>%
  select(id, age, height, weight, dibpat, smoke, behpat)
wcgs.sub2
```

## Grouped summaries with `summarize()`

`summarise()` or `summarize()` collapses a data frame to a single row.

```{r summarize mean height and correlation of key vars}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
  summarize(mean.ht = mean(height, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd.ht = sd(height, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  round(digits = 2)
```

## Using the pipe (`%>%`) to filter and summarize

```{r summarize correlation of height and weight}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
 filter(dibpat == "Type A") %>%
 summarize(pearson.r = cor(height, weight), 
  spearman.r = cor(height, weight, method = "spearman")) %>%
 round(digits = 3) %>%
 knitr::kable()
```

## Using `group_by()` with summarize to look group-by-group

```{r summarize correlation within behavior patterns}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
  group_by(behpat) %>%
  summarize(
    pearson.r = round(cor(height, weight),3) ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Using `group_by()` to look at separated groups

You might have tried this approach instead, but it throws an error...

```{r summarize correlation within behavior patterns but apply rounding incorrectly, eval=FALSE}
wcgs.sub2 %>%
  group_by(behpat) %>%
  summarize(
    pearson.r = cor(height, weight)) %>%
  round(digits = 3) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

>- Why doesn't this work?
>- When R sees the round command, it tries to apply it to every element of the table, including the behavior pattern labels, which aren't numbers. So it throws an error.

## Add new variables with `mutate()`

`mutate()` adds new columns that are functions of existing columns to the end of your data set.

Suppose we want to calculate the weight/height ratio for each subject.

```{r add weight to height ratio to the data as a new column}
wcgs.sub3 <- wcgs.sub2 %>%
    select(id, weight, height) %>%
    mutate(wh.ratio = weight / height)
wcgs.sub3
```

## On Coding and dplyr

1. Learn `dplyr`, and use it to do most of your data management within R.
    + `dplyr` is mostly about these key verbs, and piping, for our purposes
    + some tasks produce results which be confusing, we're here to help
2. `dplyr` is most useful in combination with other elements of the `tidyverse`, most prominently `ggplot2`.

# The Printer Case Study

## The Printer Case, Setup

Get with your Project group.

```{r printer1-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/printer1.png")
```

## The Printer Case, Main Table

```{r printer2-fig, out.width = '90%', fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/printer2.png")
```

## The Printer Case Discussion, Part 1

Fifty days of data. Fifth floor employees were given a card to operate their printer. Third floor employees were not.

1. Is this a randomized trial or an observational study?
2. What is the outcome we are studying?
3. What are the two treatments/exposures/interventions being compared?
4. What controls are in place as part of the study's design?
5. **Key Question**: Will the card accounting system effectively lower usage if implemented across the firm?

## The Printer Case Discussion

Go.

## Printer Case: Numerical Summary

```{r printer1}
printer <- read.csv("printer.csv") %>% tbl_df
summary(printer)
```

## Printer Case: Scatterplot (r = 0.11)

```{r printer scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer, aes(x = Third, y = Fifth)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18)) + 
  labs(x = "Third Floor Pages", y = "Fifth Floor Pages")
```

## Printer Case: Gather the Columns

First, we'll gather up the data so that we can plot it more easily.

```{r printer2}
printer2 <- tidyr::gather(printer, Floor, Pages, -Day)
printer2
```

## Printer Case: Comparison Boxplot

```{r printer 2 boxplots, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(printer2, aes(x = Floor, y = Pages, fill = Floor)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))
```

## Numerical Summary comparing the Two Floors

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(Pages ~ Floor, data = printer2)
```

## Statistical Inference comparing the Means?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
t.test(Pages ~ Floor, data = printer2)
```

```
Welch Two Sample t-test (Edited Output)

data:  Pages by Floor
sample estimates:
mean in group Fifth mean in group Third 
              426.2               428.2 

alternative hypothesis: 
true difference in means is not equal to 0

t = -0.053344, df = 97.979, p-value = 0.9576
95 percent confidence interval: -76.40  72.40
```

## Statistical Inference comparing the Means?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
t.test(Pages ~ Floor, data = printer2, 
       conf.level = 0.90, var.equal = TRUE)
```

```

ggplot(printer2, aes(x = Day, y = Pages, col = Floor)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16)) + 
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Floor) +
  labs(title = "Monitoring on Fifth Floor Reduced Pages")
```

# Project Task A Discussion Time

## Task A requires three things of your group

1. Develop and propose 2-3 research questions for Study 1
2. Propose 6-10 "homemade" survey questions for Study 1
3. Propose a "scale" for Study 1 that relates to (at least one of) your research questions.

Complete details at https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/

- Sample research questions at the Class 11 README and Class 12 README page.
