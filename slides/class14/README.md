## Demonstration Projects (Study 1 is "complete", Study 2 is not)

- I've now posted an essentially **complete** Project Demonstration for Study 1 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1. This is a demonstration of what we'll be looking for in your end-of-semester portfolio in Task G. 
    - The actual Study 1 demo materials are located in a Google Drive folder linked on that page.
- Incomplete information on the Project Demonstration for Study 2 is now available, too, at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study2, and there, again, is a link to a (different) Google Drive folder there.
    - To use the R Markdown approach taken in these Demos, you'll need to install the `rmdformats` package. I've added this to our [list of recommended R packages to install](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/software/packages.md).

## Sweeney Todd's Final Three Performances 

are on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and on Sunday at 2:00. If you'd like to come, buy tickets in advance at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211, although I expect they'll also be available at the door, at least on Sunday. Thanks for putting up with these notes, not that I really gave you much of a choice in the matter.

## Visualization of the Day

Building on our low-stakes visualization from last time, consider [this interesting R material on perceptions of probability and numbers](https://github.com/zonination/perceptions). The data shown come from a poll of Reddit users asking: What [probability/number] would you assign to the phrase "[phrase]"? for several phrases people use to express statements about uncertain events. I particularly liked this pair of visualizations, from https://github.com/zonination/perceptions.

## One Last Thing

- You might enjoy this presentation by Garrick Aden-Buie from 2018-01-23, entitled "[A Gentle Guide to the Grammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/trug-ggplot2/#1)". I did, at any rate. Lots of Star Wars examples, and special guest appearances by Muppets...
