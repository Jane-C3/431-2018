## Today's Materials

- The slides are available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class14/431_class-14-slides_2018.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class14/431_class-14-slides_2018.Rmd), above.
- Class 14 audio files will appear as soon as they are available.

## Coming Up

1. You should have finished reading Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style* by now. I hope that was useful to you.
2. [Project Task B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) remains due at noon tomorrow (Friday 2018-10-12).
    - As of 9:25 AM on 2018-10-11, **40**/51 students have completed this form. 
    - Still waiting on: Ali Aguilar, Amy Attaway, Yijiang Chen, Sebastian Garcia-medina, Elena Jiang, Haojia Li, Larry Liu, Bolin Song, Afra Syed and Pranjal Vaidya.
    - **One Key Thing** In specifying time slots, you must pick time slots on each of at least **two different days**. So you can pick seven (or more) slots on one day, and just one slot on one of the other days, but that is the minimum. As of 9:30 AM, there were still two people who needed to fix their form to address this, and I've emailed them. 
    - Assuming everyone completes the task on time, you'll get the project schedule on Tuesday 2018-10-16 in class.
3. [Project Task A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) is now due at noon on **Monday** 2018-10-15.
    - Individual submissions are trickling in to Canvas, and I am caught up, I believe.
    - Please make sure your group has told me who will submit the group work on Task A. 
        - As of 9:25 AM 2018-10-11, I know who will submit from Frontroll, Group Biostat, Pink Ladies, and Significant PaRty. 
        - Still waiting on Blue Group, Chaos, Smart_Group, Team Awesome, The Foxes, and TuRkey.
    - Remember that your group must submit at least 2 research questions and 6 survey questions, but you can submit more of either. Each research question from your group should have a minimum of two connected survey question suggestions. In addition, you must propose a scale, and that also needs to be connected to at least one of your research questions. Please review the instructions for Task A for full details.
4. [Homework 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework5) is due next Friday 2018-10-19.
    - **NEW**: I modified Homework 5 on 2018-10-10 to now consist of **eight** questions, instead of the original *eleven*. Make sure you [use this new version](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework5/README.md).
    - You can do questions 1-6 now, but to do questions 7 and 8, you might want to review the material on Comparing Two Means in our Course Notes (especially [Chapters 24 and 25](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-book/comparing-two-means-using-paired-samples.html)), and also in the [Slides for Class 15](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/slides/class15) that I've already posted, and that we'll discuss on Tuesday.
5. [Project Task C and Task D](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) are due at noon on 2018-10-23.
6. By 2018-10-24, we'll expect you to have read *The Signal and the Noise* through Chapter 11.

## Demonstration Projects (Study 1 is "complete", Study 2 is not)

- I've now posted an essentially **complete** Project Demonstration for Study 1 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1. This is a demonstration of what we'll be looking for in your end-of-semester portfolio in Task G. 
    - The actual Study 1 demo materials are located in a Google Drive folder linked on that page.
- Incomplete information on the Project Demonstration for Study 2 is now available, too, at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study2, and there, again, is a link to a (different) Google Drive folder there.
    - To use the R Markdown approach taken in these Demos, you'll need to install the `rmdformats` package. I've added this to our [list of recommended R packages to install](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/software/packages.md).

## Sweeney Todd's Final Three Performances 

are on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and on Sunday at 2:00. If you'd like to come, buy tickets in advance at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211, although I expect they'll also be available at the door, at least on Sunday. Thanks for putting up with these notes, not that I really gave you much of a choice in the matter.

## Visualization of the Day

Building on our low-stakes visualization from last time, consider [this interesting R material on perceptions of probability and numbers](https://github.com/zonination/perceptions). The data shown come from a poll of Reddit users asking: What [probability/number] would you assign to the phrase "[phrase]"? for several phrases people use to express statements about uncertain events. I particularly liked this pair of visualizations, from https://github.com/zonination/perceptions.

## One Last Thing

- You might enjoy this presentation by Garrick Aden-Buie from 2018-01-23, entitled "[A Gentle Guide to the Grammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/trug-ggplot2/#1)". I did, at any rate. Lots of Star Wars examples, and special guest appearances by Muppets...
