## Today's Materials

- The slides are available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class14/431_class-14-slides_2018.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class14/431_class-14-slides_2018.Rmd), above.
- Class 14 audio files are now available, and posted above.

## Coming Up, besides Project Task A

1. You should have finished reading Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style* by now. I hope that was useful to you.
2. [Project Task B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) remains due at noon tomorrow (Friday 2018-10-12).
    - As of 2:50 PM on 2018-10-11, **43**/51 students have completed this form, at http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-signup-taskB. 
    - **One Key Thing** In specifying time slots, you must pick time slots on each of at least **two different days**. So you can pick seven (or more) slots on one day, and just one slot on one of the other days, but that is the minimum. 
    - Assuming everyone completes the task on time, you'll get the project schedule on Tuesday 2018-10-16 in class.
3. [Homework 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework5) is due next Friday 2018-10-19.
    - **NEW**: I modified Homework 5 on 2018-10-10 to now consist of **eight** questions, instead of the original *eleven*. Make sure you [use this new version](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework5/README.md).
    - You can do questions 1-6 now, but to do questions 7 and 8, you might want to review the material on Comparing Two Means in our Course Notes (especially [Chapters 24 and 25](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-book/comparing-two-means-using-paired-samples.html)), and also in the [Slides for Class 15](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/slides/class15) that I've already posted, and that we'll discuss on Tuesday.
4. [Project Task C and Task D](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) are currently still planned to be due at noon on 2018-10-23, but I may wind up changing the deadline for one or both Tasks (pushing it later) depending on how things go today, and how things go with the group work in Task A, which I won't know until Monday after noon. Pushing it later has other unfortunate consequences, but we'll see.
5. By 2018-10-24, we'll expect you to have read *The Signal and the Noise* through Chapter 11.

## [Project Task A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) is now due at noon on **Monday** 2018-10-15.

1. Individual submissions are trickling in to Canvas, and I am caught up, I believe. Submit your individual (Study 2) work at any time between now and noon Monday.
2. Remember that your group must submit at least 2 research questions and 6 survey questions, but you can submit more of either. Each research question from your group should have a minimum of two connected survey question suggestions. In addition, you must propose a scale, and that also needs to be connected to at least one of your research questions. Please review the instructions for Task A for full details.
3. As you develop survey questions and scales, you may have questions. Here are a few I have heard in the past few days:
    - "Can we use (in our set of 6+ additional survey questions) items that Dr. Love is already planning to put in the survey?" **No. You're trying to add new questions, not repeat old ones. Your research question may refer to one or more of the 15 questions I'm putting into the survey, but you can use those questions either for grouping or as an outcome, but not both, so at least one part (group or outcome) will have to be original to your group's survey questions.**
    - "Can we ask about performance in this class or any other academic endeavor?" **On the survey? No. That will be rejected out of hand.**
    - "Can we ask questions that have been asked in past surveys?" **Yes.**
    - "Can we use a scale that has been asked in past surveys?" **Yes.**
    - "Does each survey question we suggest have to be linked to one of the research questions we propose, in an obvious way?" **Yes. Your scale, too. That's why you can have more than 2 research questions.**
    - "Will I, as an individual, need to use the research questions or survey questions that my group winds up proposing in my analyses later this semester?" **No.**
    - "Will I, as an individual, have an opportunity to suggest additional questions for the survey after this initial work in Task A?" **Yes, in Task C.**
    - "Will all of the questions we suggest in Task A for the survey make it into the survey?" **No. I will edit the survey quite a bit before publishing the draft that you will review for Tasks C and D. Also, I expect multiple groups to suggest similar questions in some cases, and I will combine those, to the degree that I can in the available time.**
    - "When will we see the official draft of the survey that we will use to do Tasks C and D?" **Wednesday 2018-10-17.**

## Demonstration Projects (Study 1 is "complete", Study 2 is not)

- I've now posted an essentially **complete** Project Demonstration for Study 1 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1. This is a demonstration of what we'll be looking for in your end-of-semester portfolio in Task G. 
    - The actual Study 1 demo materials are located in a Google Drive folder linked on that page.
- Incomplete information on the Project Demonstration for Study 2 is now available, too, at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study2, and there, again, is a link to a (different) Google Drive folder there.
    - To use the R Markdown approach taken in these Demos, you'll need to install the `rmdformats` package. I've added this to our [list of recommended R packages to install](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/software/packages.md).

## Sweeney Todd's Final Three Performances 

are on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and on Sunday at 2:00. If you'd like to come, buy tickets in advance at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211, although some will likely be available at the door (The Brecksville Theatre, 49 Public Square in Brecksville), especially on Sunday. If you do decide to come, you could see what happens next, in person. On the other hand, you may not want to know...

## Visualization of the Day

Building on our low-stakes visualization from last time, consider [this interesting R material on perceptions of probability and numbers](https://github.com/zonination/perceptions). The data shown come from a poll of Reddit users asking: What [probability/number] would you assign to the phrase "[phrase]"? for several phrases people use to express statements about uncertain events. I particularly liked this pair of visualizations, from https://github.com/zonination/perceptions.

## One Last Thing

- You might enjoy this presentation by Garrick Aden-Buie from 2018-01-23, entitled "[A Gentle Guide to the Grammar of Graphics with `ggplot2`](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/trug-ggplot2/#1)". I did, at any rate. Lots of Star Wars examples, and special guest appearances by Muppets...
