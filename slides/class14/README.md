## Demonstration Projects

- I've begun to post the Project Demonstration for Study 1 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study1. This is a demonstration of what we'll be looking for in your end-of-semester portfolio in Task G. 
    - We will make both HTML and R Markdown versions of the Study 1 demonstration available to you as soon as possible. We took down the old versions because they weren't executing properly.
- When that's done, I'll post the Project Demonstration for Study 2 at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/tree/master/demo_study2, which will also describe what we want to see in the portfolio (Task G).

## Sweeney Todd's Final Three Performances 

are on Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and on Sunday at 2:00. If you'd like to come, buy tickets in advance at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211, although I expect they'll also be available at the door, at least on Sunday. Thanks for putting up with these notes, not that I really gave you much of a choice in the matter.
