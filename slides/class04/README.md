# 431 Fall 2018 Class 04: 2018-09-06

## Today's Materials

- The slides are available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class04/431_class-04-slides_2018.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class04/431_class-04-slides_2018.Rmd).
- The audio files will be posted after class.
- Today's main analysis involves some data from NHANES (which is the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm)), and this example is covered (in great depth) in Chapters 3-6 of [our Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-book/dataviz.html).
- Another item that may be useful to you is a more polished analysis of the Day 1 survey, building on Class 3.
    - Here is [the .csv file of the survey data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class04/surveyday1_2018.csv), the [R Markdown file for this survey analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class04/class4-survey.Rmd), and the [HTML result](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class04/class4-survey.html).

## Deliverables Coming Soon

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework1) is due on Friday 2018-09-07 at Noon. Submit your R Markdown and HTML files via Canvas. 
    - We treat work arriving before 1 PM as on time. It is **far** better to turn in incomplete work on time than complete work late for these homework assignments.
    - We encourage you to edit your code ruthlessly, and submit a Markdown document and HTML result that includes only the pieces you actually want us to review. The most important thing you should do before submitting your work is read over the HTML and see that it includes what you mean it to include, and that (for instance) axis labels show up properly, etc. and that various "false starts" don't turn up in the final result.
    - The answer sketch for Homework 1 should be [available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework1) on Friday sometime after 1 PM.
- [Homework 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework2) is due the following Friday 2018-09-14, also at noon.
- Read Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* (Introduction and Chapter 1) before 2018-09-17.
    
## Minute Papers after Class 3

Everyone responded! Thanks! I've gathered feedback into a PDF [displayed above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class04/431-2018_minute03_feedback.pdf). We'll do this again after each Tuesday class.

## Today's Announcements

### Get help at any time by emailing **431-help at case dot edu** or visiting Office Hours.

1. Apply the 15-minute rule. If you can't solve a problem in 15 minutes, **ask for help** either from us or from Google. You are **absolutely supposed** to use Google and the TAs (and Dr. Love) to improve your code.

2. When asking for help with an R problem from **431-help at case dot edu**, we ask you to try to make it easier for us to help you. If you attach your **R Markdown file** (note this has the extension .Rmd), and a detailed explanation of the problem you see, we can often solve the problem in an email. Without the R Markdown file, we can rarely do anything except ask more questions.

3. When you get a response from one of us on **431-help at case dot edu** we REPLY ALL so that all of the TAs (and Dr. Love) can see the result. If you need to respond, please fight your usual urge and **REPLY ALL** as well so that we can all still help.

### Professor Love is giving a research talk (together with Dr. Shari Bolen) on Friday morning

The talk is entitled "Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Grant: Hypertension Implementation in 9 Safety Net Clinics" and is from 9 to 10:30 AM in Room R219 at the Rammelkamp building on the campus of MetroHealth Medical Center. For more information, ask Dr. Love, or visit http://chrp.org/events/
