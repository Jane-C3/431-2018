- Data analysis is as much about communication as it is about your data.
- Splitting data so that you can analyse 70% and then use the other 30% to verify
    - Break big data into small digestible chunks
    - Separating big data into two sets, and summarizing the data on one and analysis on the second.
- How to improve the appearance of data in different types of visualizations to better communicate what the data is showing
    - Using Bland-Altman plots, finding out what they are
    - Always thought pie chart is a good way to display data until reading this book and looking at the example/figure.
    - How to create a good title - communicates the message of the plot
    - Dynamite plots are bad ways to visualize data
- log transformations to spread out data with varying orders of magnitude
    - Transforming right-skewed data via log to make it more normally distributed.
- How Leek explained how to deal with confounding variables, and how they can skew one's conclusions about the data.
- Sharing Data
    - Don't use multiple excel tabs
- How he emphasized the difference between exploratory analysis and analysis to be used in publications. Analyses in publications should only be used if they're helpful for the audience's interpretation.
- The importance of having a clear table 1 - making sure the variables are clearly outlined before you manipulate or analyze relationships.
