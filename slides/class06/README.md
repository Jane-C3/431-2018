- Read the Introduction and Chapter 1 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* before our next class. 
  - The main issue is to get these read so that you can complete [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework3).
  - [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework3) is due next Friday 2018-09-21 at Noon. 
  - Another thing to read before doing Homework 3 is [Chapter 8 (on Assessing Normality)](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-book/assessing-normality.html) of our Course Notes.

## Today's Announcements

1. Homework 1 is now complete.
  - The Answer Sketch is now available in [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework1/431-2018-hw1sketch.pdf), and in [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/homework/Homework1/431-2018-hw1sketch.Rmd).
  - Homework 1 Grades are now part of the [Coded Grading Roster](http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades), which lives at http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades in a Google Sheet which requires you to log in to Google via CWRU. 
     - Look for the Homework 1 Tab, and you'll need your 3-digit Homework Code for the semester, which Professor Love emailed to you on 2018-09-13. 
    - When we have grades for other Homeworks, they will appear in new tabs of the same sheet. 
    - HW 1 grades were excellent, as we'd expected, with the modal grade being 100/100. 
    - We anticipate that grades on HW1 and HW2 will be generally stronger than the grades on the later Homework.
2. Thanks to those of you who completed the **Minute Paper After Class 5** - please visit http://bit.ly/431-2018-minute05-response for my general responses, plus I sent some responses individually via email.
3. There are some issues with dead links to materials from Duke and from Vanderbilt in Section 2.2.1.2 of the **Project Instructions**. Those are now fixed, including the [right link for Duke](https://sites.duke.edu/urgws/files/2014/02/Research-Questions_WS-handout.pdf), and the [right link for Vanderbilt](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/writing/wp-content/uploads/sites/164/2016/10/Formulating-Your-Research-Question.pdf). Complete [Project Instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/) will be in place before we start work on the Project on 2018-09-25.
4. You may be interested in becoming a [student member of the American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Statistics-Students.aspx). It's been a great organization for me, and if you're looking into statistics or a related field as a career, you should definitely consider this seriously. The student rate is $25 per year, and some departments have occasionally sponsored their students as well. To join, [visit this link](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/JoinRenew/JoinMemberType.aspx?membertype=IREG&utm_source=informz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=asa&_zs=XgXOe1&_zl=gJ095). 
5. There is a brand new course on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) called **Working with Data in the Tidyverse**, by Alison Hill. This looks great. Also worth considering are the **Categorical Data in the Tidyverse** and **Working with Dates and Times in R** courses, which I'll add to the recommended list of courses in the [Datacamp section of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/datacamp.html) as soon I can.

## Today's In-Class Task about Jeff Leek's book requires a link.

We're going to ask you to do two tasks in a group of about 5 people today (we need ten groups). One of those tasks will ask someone from your group to fill in the Google Form at http://bit.ly/431-2018-class6-leek.
