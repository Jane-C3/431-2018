## Deliverables Coming Soon

- [Homework 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework2) is due Friday 2018-09-14 at Noon. Submit your work (again, R Markdown and HTML files) via Canvas.
- Read the Introduction and Chapter 1 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* before our next class. The main issue is to get these read so that you can complete [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework3), which is due next Friday 2018-09-21 at Noon.

## Today's Announcements

1. Homework 1 is now complete.
  - The Answer Sketch is now available in [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework1/431-2018-hw1sketch.pdf), and in [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/homework/Homework1/431-2018-hw1sketch.Rmd).
  - Homework 1 Grades are now part of the [Coded Grading Roster](http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades), which lives at http://bit.ly/431-2018-hw-grades in a Google Sheet which requires you to log in to Google via CWRU. 
     -Look for the Homework 1 Tab, and you'll need your 3-digit Homework Code for the semester, which Professor Love emailed to you on 2018-09-13. 
    - When we have grades for other Homeworks, they will appear in new tabs of the same sheet. 
    - HW 1 grades were excellent, as we'd expected, with the modal grade being 100/100. 
    - We anticipate that grades on HW1 and HW2 will be generally stronger than the grades on the later Homework.
2. Thanks to those of you who completed the Minute Paper After Class 5 - please visit http://bit.ly/431-2018-minute05-response for my general responses. We'll discuss those in class today.
3. You may be interested in becoming a [student member of the American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/asa/education/Statistics-Students.aspx). It's been a great organization for me, and if you're looking into statistics or a related field as a career, you should definitely consider this seriously. The student rate is $25 per year, and some departments have occasionally sponsored their students as well. To join, [visit this link](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/JoinRenew/JoinMemberType.aspx?membertype=IREG&utm_source=informz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=asa&_zs=XgXOe1&_zl=gJ095). 

## Today's In-Class Task about Jeff Leek's book requires a link.

We're going to ask you to do two tasks in a group of about 5 people today (we need ten groups). One of those tasks will ask someone from your group to fill in the Google Form at http://bit.ly/431-2018-class6-leek.
