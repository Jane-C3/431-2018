## Today's Agenda

1. Announcements, including Minute Papers, HW 1 grades, etc.
2. Who Wrote the Anti-Trump *New York Times* op-ed: R in Action
3. *Elements of Data Analytic Style* - What was the most useful thing?
4. Visualizing NHANES: **Course Notes** Chapters 3-6
5. Kidney Cancer Maps (maybe)

## Task 1: Elements of Data Analytic Style

Last time, I asked you to write down (so that you can share) the most important/interesting/surprising thing you learned from reading the four chapters of Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*.

Form a group of about 5 people. We'll need 10 groups. Your group will be identified by the folder you receive, as Group A, B, ..., J. Now, as a group, 

1. Have everyone read out their statement. Do this efficiently.
2. Identify **three** statements that you are willing to share, as a group.
3. Have one person from your group type two of those statements into the Google Form at http://bit.ly/431-2018-class6-leek.
4. Pick another one worth sharing, and have someone else ready to give us that one (orally) when time is called.

## Return to NHANES -- As before...

```{r}
library(NHANES); library(skimr)
library(magrittr); library(tidyverse)

set.seed(20180911) # note same seed as Class 5

nh_2 <- sample_n(NHANES, size = 1000) %>%
    select(ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, BMI, 
           Pulse, Race1, HealthGen, Diabetes)

nh_3 <- nh_2 %>%
    filter(Age > 20 & Age < 80) %>%
    select(ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, BMI, 
           Pulse, Race1, HealthGen, Diabetes) %>%
    na.omit
```

# Looking at a Single Batch of Data

## Visualizing the distribution of BMI in `nh_3`: 1/3

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = BMI)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "purple", col = "white") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of BMI data in nh_3")
```

## Code for Histogram

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = BMI)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "purple", col = "white") +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of BMI data in nh_3")
```

Histogram tells us something about:

- the **center** of the distribution
- its **spread**
- its **shape** (skew, outliers, multimodality)

## Visualizing the distribution of BMI in `nh_3`: 2/3

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = "nh_3 subjects", y = BMI)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "purple") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "", title = "Boxplot of BMI data in nh_3") 
```

## Code for Boxplot

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = "nh_3 subjects", y = BMI)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "purple") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "", title = "Boxplot of BMI data in nh_3") 
```

- Boxplot is less granular than a histogram, but represents a five-number summary (median, quartiles, minimum and maximum) and also flags outlier candidates.
- Note the use of a name, in quotation marks, rather than a data element in the x position of the aesthetics for the plot. What does this do?
- What was the impact of `coord_flip()`?
- What does `labs(x = "")` do?

## Visualizing the distribution of BMI in `nh_3`: 3/3

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = "nh_3 subjects", y = BMI)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(x = "", title = "Violin Plot of BMI data in nh_3") 
```

## Code for Violin Plot

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = "nh_3 subjects", y = BMI)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  labs(x = "", title = "Violin Plot of BMI data in nh_3") 
```

## A Violin Plot and a Boxplot?

Here's the code. What do you think this will produce?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = "nh_3 subjects", y = BMI)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "white") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "cornflowerblue",
               outlier.color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "", 
       title = "Violin Plot and Boxplot of BMI in nh_3") 
```

## Combined Violin Plot and Boxplot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = "nh_3 subjects", y = BMI)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "white") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "cornflowerblue",
               outlier.color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "", 
       title = "Violin Plot and Boxplot of BMI in nh_3") 
```

## Numerical Summary of BMI, via `summary`

If we have loaded the `magrittr` package in addition to the `tidyverse`, we can use the %$% pipe to obtain a summary of one variable.

```{r}
nh_3 %$% summary(BMI)
```

Or we can use this sort of notation:

```{r}
summary(nh_3$BMI)
```

- What don't we get from `summary` that we'd like to see?

## Numerical Summary of BMI, with `favstats`

Try the `favstats` function from the `mosaic` package, which uses a different syntax.

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~ BMI, data = nh_3)
```

## Numerical Summary of BMI, via `skimr`

I'm a real fan of the `skimr` package, in particular its `skim` function, which works nicely with the tidyverse, up to a point.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nh_3 %>% skimr::skim(BMI)
```

![](images/skim_BMI.png)

## Looks great, but ...

The histogram doesn't show well (by default) in our slides set-up, so I had to take a screenshot. Otherwise, we'd get this...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
nh_3 %>% skimr::skim(BMI)
```

## Can run `skim` without the histogram

```{r}
skimr::skim_with(numeric = list(hist = NULL))
nh_3 %>% skimr::skim(BMI)
```

# Making Comparisons Across Groups

## Visualizing BMI by Gender: Code

Plot 1:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "white") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

Plot 2:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = Gender, y = BMI, 
                        fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Plot 1 is a set of faceted histograms

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "white") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## Plot 2 is a comparison boxplot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = Gender, y = BMI, 
                        fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Can we make a comparison violin plot? With boxes?

Sure.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = Gender, y = BMI, 
                        fill = Gender)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "white") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Comparison violin plot with boxes!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = Gender, y = BMI, 
                        fill = Gender)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, fill = "white") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```


## Numerical Summary of BMI by Gender: 1/3

```{r}
nh_3 %>%
    group_by(Gender) %>%
    summarize("Count" = n(), "Mean BMI" = mean(BMI), 
              "Skew1" = (mean(BMI) - median(BMI))/sd(BMI))
```

- If skew1 < 0.2, we rarely infer anything but symmetry.
- If skew1 > 0.2, we might infer substantial skew, but DTDP.

## Skew1 and A Relevant Picture (code on next slide)

Do the female data appear skewed? Do the male data?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "black") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## Skew1 and A Relevant Picture (code)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nh_3, aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "black") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)
```

## Numerical Summary of BMI by Gender: 2/3

```{r}
nh_3 %>%
    filter(Gender == "female") %$%
    summary(BMI)
```

```{r}
nh_3 %>%
    filter(Gender == "male") %$%
    psych::describe(BMI)
```

## Numerical Summary of BMI by Gender: 3/3

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(BMI ~ Gender, data = nh_3)
```

## BMI by Gender **and** Diabetes status? 1/2

```{r}
nh_3 %>%
    group_by(Gender, Diabetes) %>%
    summarize("Count" = n(), 
              "skew1" = (mean(BMI) - median(BMI))/sd(BMI),
              mean(BMI), median(BMI))
```

## BMI by Gender **and** Diabetes status? 2/2

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(BMI ~ Gender + Diabetes, data = nh_3)
```


## Does Diabetes affect Pulse-BMI association? (code)

Could we see whether subjects who have been told they have diabetes show different BMI-pulse rate patterns than the subjects who haven't? 

- Let's try doing this by changing the **shape** *and* the **color** of the points based on diabetes status.

```{r nh_3_bmivspulsewithdm-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = BMI, y = Pulse, 
           color = Diabetes, shape = Diabetes)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "BMI vs. Pulse rate (NHANES ages 21-79)") +
    facet_wrap(~ Diabetes, labeller = "label_both") + 
    theme_bw()
```

## Does Diabetes status affect Pulse-BMI association?

```{r nh_3_bmivspulsewithdm-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = BMI, y = Pulse, 
           color = Diabetes, shape = Diabetes)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "BMI vs. Pulse rate (NHANES ages 21-79)") +
    facet_wrap(~ Diabetes, labeller = "label_both") + 
    theme_bw()
```

## Correlation of BMI and Pulse by Diabetes?

- Recall that the correlation coefficient for the relationship between BMI and Pulse in the full sample was quite close to zero. 
  - Specifically, it was `r nh_3 %$% cor(BMI, Pulse) %>% round(.,3)`
- Grouped by diabetes status, do we get a different story?

```{r}
nh_3 %>%
  group_by(Diabetes) %>%
  summarize(cor(BMI, Pulse)) 
```

# Working with a Categorical Outcome (Self-Reported General Health) in NHANES

## General Health Status

Here's a Table of the General Health Status results. This is a self-reported rating of each subject's health on a five point scale (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor.)

```{r tabHealthGen1-tab}
nh_3 %>%
    select(HealthGen) %>%
    table() %>%
    addmargins()
```


The `HealthGen` data are categorical, which means that summarizing them with averages isn't as appealing as looking at percentages, proportions and rates.

## Bar Chart for Categorical Data

Usually, a **bar chart** is the best choice for a graphing a variable made up of categories.

```{r HealthGengraph1-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar()
```

## Original Bar Chart of General Health

```{r HealthGengraph1-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, aes(x = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar()
```

## Improving the Bar Chart

There are lots of things we can do to make this plot fancier.

```{r HealthGengraph2-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Number of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health (ages 21-79)")
```


## The Improved Bar Chart

```{r HealthGengraph2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Number of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health (ages 21-79)")
```

## Or, we can really go crazy... (code on next slide)

```{r HealthGengraph3-fig, echo = FALSE}
nh_3 %>%
    count(HealthGen) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(pct = round(prop.table(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = HealthGen, y = pct, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE, col = FALSE) +
    geom_text(aes(y = pct + 1,    # nudge above top of bar
                  label = paste0(pct, '%')),  # prettify
              position = position_dodge(width = .9), 
              size = 4) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Percentage of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health (ages 21-79)") +
    theme_bw()
```

## What crazy looks like...

```{r HealthGengraph3-figcode, eval = FALSE}
nh_3 %>%
    count(HealthGen) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(pct = round(prop.table(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = HealthGen, y = pct, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE, col = FALSE) +
    geom_text(aes(y = pct + 1,    # nudge above top of bar
                  label = paste0(pct, '%')),  # prettify
              position = position_dodge(width = .9), 
              size = 4) +
    labs(x = "Self-Reported Health Status",
         y = "Percentage of NHANES subjects",
         title = "Self-Reported Health (ages 21-79)") +
    theme_bw()
```

## Working with Tables

We can add a marginal total, and compare subjects by Gender, as follows...

```{r tabHealthGen2kable-tab}
nh_3 %>%
    select(Gender, HealthGen) %>%
    table() %>%
    addmargins() %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

## Getting Row Proportions

We'll use `prop.table` and get the row proportions by feeding it a 1.

```{r tabHealthGen4-tab}
nh_3 %>%
    select(Gender, HealthGen) %>%
    table() %>%
    prop.table(.,1) %>%
    round(.,2) %>%
    knitr::kable()
```

## BMI by General Health Status

Let's consider now the relationship between self-reported overall health and body-mass index.

```{r nh_3_bmibyhealth-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) 
```

## What happens with the `Poor` category?

```{r nh_3_bmibyhealth-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) 
```

## Summary Table of BMI distribution by HealthGen

```{r, eval = FALSE}
nh_3 %>%
    group_by(HealthGen) %>%
    summarize("BMI n" = n(), 
              "Mean" = round(mean(BMI),1), 
              "SD" = round(sd(BMI),1),
              "min" = round(min(BMI),1), 
              "Q25" = round(quantile(BMI, 0.25),1),
              "median" = round(median(BMI),1), 
              "Q75" = round(quantile(BMI, 0.75),1),
              "max" = round(max(BMI),1)) %>%
    knitr::kable() 
```

- Resulting table is shown in the next slide.

## Not many self-identify in the `Poor` category

```{r, echo = FALSE}
nh_3 %>%
    group_by(HealthGen) %>%
    summarize("BMI n" = n(), 
              "Mean" = round(mean(BMI),1), 
              "SD" = round(sd(BMI),1),
              "min" = round(min(BMI),1), 
              "Q25" = round(quantile(BMI, 0.25),1),
              "median" = round(median(BMI),1), 
              "Q75" = round(quantile(BMI, 0.75),1),
              "max" = round(max(BMI),1)) %>%
    knitr::kable() 
```

## BMI by Gender and General Health Status

We'll start with two panels of boxplots to try to understand the relationships between BMI, General Health Status and Gender. 

```{r nh_3_bmibyhealthbygender1-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_light() +
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") 
```

- Note the use of `coord_flip` to rotate the graph 90 degrees.
- Note the use of a new theme, called `theme_light()`.

## BMI by Gender and General Health Status Boxplots

```{r nh_3_bmibyhealthbygender1-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = HealthGen, y = BMI, fill = HealthGen)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ Gender) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_light() +
    labs(title = "BMI by Health Status (NHANES ages 21-79)",
         y = "Body-mass index", 
         x = "Self-Reported Overall Health") 
```

## Histograms of BMI by Health and Gender

Here are doubly faceted histograms, which can help address similar questions.

```{r nh_3_bmibyhealthbygender2-figcode, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Gender, Overall Health",
         x = "Body-mass index") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(HealthGen ~ Gender) +
    theme_dark()
```

- Note the use of `facet_grid` to specify rows and columns.
- Note the use of a new theme, called `theme_dark()`.

## Histograms of BMI by Health and Gender

```{r nh_3_bmibyhealthbygender2-fig, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = nh_3, 
       aes(x = BMI, fill = Gender)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 20) + 
    labs(title = "BMI by Gender, Overall Health",
         x = "Body-mass index") + 
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    facet_grid(HealthGen ~ Gender) +
    theme_dark()
```


## Conclusions

This is just a small piece of the toolbox for visualizations that we'll create in this class. Many additional tools are on the way, but the main idea won't change. Using the `ggplot2` package, we can accomplish several critical tasks in creating a visualization, including:

- Identifying (and labeling) the axes and titles
- Identifying a type of `geom` to use, like a point, bar or histogram
- Changing fill, color, shape, size to facilitate comparisons
- Building "small multiples" of plots with faceting

Good data visualizations make it easy to see the data, and `ggplot2`'s tools make it relatively difficult to make a really bad graph.

## Task 2: Kidney Cancer Death Rates

Your map shows U.S. counties. 

- The shaded counties are in the top 10% of age-standardized rates for death due to cancer of the kidney/ureter for white males, in 1980-1989.

### Your Tasks

1. Describe the patterns you see in the map.
2. Speculate as to the cause of these patterns.

### The Signal and the Noise

Please read the Introduction and Chapter 1 before Tuesday's class

## Notes on the Kidney Cancer example, 1

I first asked you what you noticed about the map, in the hope that someone would point out the obvious pattern, which is that many of the countries in the Great Plains but relatively few near the coasts are shaded.

- Why might that be? Could these be the counties with more old people? Ah, but these rates are age-adjusted.
- They're mostly in rural areas: could the health care there be worse than in major cities? Or perhaps people living in rural areas have less healthy diets, or are exposed to more harmful chemicals? Maybe, but the confusing fact is that the highest 10% and the lowest 10% each show disproportionately higher rates in those Great Plains counties.

## Notes on the Kidney Cancer example, 2

- Consider a county with 100 white males. If it has even one kidney death in the 1980s, its rate is 1 per thousand per year, which is among the highest in the nation. If it has no such deaths, its rate will be 0, which is the lowest in the nation.
- The observed rates for smaller counties are *much* more variable, and hence they are more likely to be shaded, even if nothing special is truly going on.
- If a small county has an observed rate of 1 per thousand per year, it's probably random fluctuation. But if a large county (like Cuyahoga) has a very high rate, it is probably a real phenomenon.

My source for this example was Andrew Gelman and Deborah Nolan's book *Teaching Statistics: a bag of tricks* which is the source of a number of things we'll see in the course, including some of the "age guessing" example we've previously done.
