## Coming Up

1. The Project Presentation Schedule is posted as a Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-schedule.
   - Everyone got one of the 8 (or more) time slots where they said they were available.
      - 3 people didn't specify a first or second choice. 
      - Of the remaining 48, 27 (56%) got their first choice, and 12 (25%) got their second choice, so 9 (19%) were left with one of their other available time slots. 
   - If something comes up, or you have any questions, email Dr. Love.
2. Update on Project Task A submissions.
    - Once you have submitted your project group work to Canvas and I have reviewed it, my detailed reactions to your group's work on Project Task A will be found in the Google Doc at http://bit.ly/431-2018-projecttaskA-groupwork.
    - Once your individual project work has been approved, you'll [find it listed here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project/blob/master/OKtaskA.md).
3. What You'll Be doing on Thursday, when Dr. Love is out of town.
   - You'll be working on [Project Task C](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2018-project/), which is **still** due at noon on Tuesday 2018-10-23. Come to class and work with your group, and with the teaching assistants, and get it all done at once. 
   - The Course Project Survey Draft is located at http://bit.ly/431-2018-draft-project-survey. Your group needs to proofread every single question and also make sure that everything your group was hoping to have included made it into the survey somehow, but you can split the work up between you. That way we have at least 10 readers (one per group) for each question before we go live. You'll also need to tell us whether any question is something you, personally, cannot answer. 
   - Please follow the complete instructions for Project Task C.
4. **Update 1**: [Homework 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework5) is now due on Friday 2018-10-26.
    - Remember, we modified Homework 5 on 2018-10-10 to now consist of **eight** questions, instead of the original *eleven*. Make sure you [use this new version](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/homework/Homework5/README.md).
5. A reminder that we don't have class next Tuesday 2018-10-23. Enjoy your Fall Break.
6. **Update 2**: [Project Task D], however, is now due at noon on Friday 2018-10-26, at the same time as Homework 5. 
7. **Update 3**: Some other things will be pushed back. Details to come.
8. By 2018-10-24, we'll expect you to have read *The Signal and the Noise* through Chapter 11.

## Visualization of the Day / One Last Thing

Shannon Ellis wrote a great blog post "[Will You Be a Halloween Hero, or the Neighborhood Dud?](http://www.shanellis.com/blog/data-driven-decision-making-halloween-candy-edition/)" which uses R to visualize information which can help you decide what candy to buy for trick-or-treaters, using [candy hierarchy survey data for 2014-2017 gathered by David Ng](http://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/). Here's the money image, which is the result of the [R code Shannon published as part of the blog](http://www.shanellis.com/blog/data-driven-decision-making-halloween-candy-edition/):
