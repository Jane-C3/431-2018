## Visualization of the Day

Shannon Ellis wrote a great blog post "[Will You Be a Halloween Hero, or the Neighborhood Dud?](http://www.shanellis.com/blog/data-driven-decision-making-halloween-candy-edition/)" which uses R to visualize information which can help you decide what candy to buy for trick-or-treaters, using [candy hierarchy survey data for 2014-2017 gathered by David Ng](http://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/). Here's the money image, which is the result of the [R code Shannon published as part of the blog](http://www.shanellis.com/blog/data-driven-decision-making-halloween-candy-edition/):
