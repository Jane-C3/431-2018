## One Last Thing

- I enjoyed this [stream of tweets](https://twitter.com/lisadebruine/status/1038800221281701888) about the tidyverse from Elizabeth Page-Gould and Lisa DeBruine, and others. Lisa makes the excellent point that the tidyverse allows you to read your code like a sentence, and that is incredibly helpful to me.
