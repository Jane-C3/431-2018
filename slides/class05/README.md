## Today's Announcements

1. Information on the Course Project has begun to appear at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-project. I hope to have a more final version available by Thursday's class. We will start working on the project in class September 25.
2. In an exciting development, [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) now exists in beta form. Here is an [article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17822562/google-dataset-search-service-scholar-scientific-journal-open-data-access) with some more details, and I'll also link to the weekly [Monday Morning Data Science](https://mailchi.mp/6dc32765278d/mmds-bouncing-into-the-week-93841?e=f2eec42851) newsletter posting. From there, I learned that the initial version will focus on environmental, social science, and government data. 
    - If you're interested, subscribe to Monday Morning Data Science from the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab [here](https://jhudatascience.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5ea551600fcdf84334e5aa6b0&id=26c0b7221a).
3. For Homework 1, Question 7, we had some [questions of general interest](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class05/homework1q7.md) that I'll discuss today. All of you should have an answer from me for your personal question as a comment on your Homework 1 submission in Canvas.

## Some Links from Today

- The Colors in R PDF I like is at http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf
- CWRU's color branding guidelines are at https://case.edu/umc/our-brand/visual-guidelines/color
- I also reference [Karl Broman's excellent presentation on displaying data badly](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs)

## One Last Thing

- I enjoyed this [stream of tweets](https://twitter.com/lisadebruine/status/1038800221281701888) about the tidyverse from Elizabeth Page-Gould and Lisa DeBruine, and others. Lisa makes the excellent point that the tidyverse allows you to read your code like a sentence, and that is incredibly helpful to me.
