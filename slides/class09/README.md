## Announcements

1. A reminder that [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework4) is due on Friday 2018-09-28 at noon. Please get it in on time. 

2. The [Answer Sketch for Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework3) will be posted shortly. My apologies for the delay. Grades should be available Thursday.

3. Today, in class, we will make use of a data set called vonJ

3. In today's class, you'll be joining a Project Group containing 4-5 students. When we do that, you'll need to have one member of your group fill out the Google Form linked at http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-groups. 
    - If anyone is missing today, Dr. Love will assign them to one of the groups that winds up with only four people, so we wind up with 10 groups of 5 students each.

4. If you're looking for data to use in your project's Study 2, and you have a medical condition you are interested in studying, you might consider searching [datamed.org](https://datamed.org/), which aspires to be a sort of PubMed for data sets. 
    - There are more than 2.3 million data sets there, and while perhaps less than 1% are completely appropriate for our project, that's still a lot of relevant data to consider. It's not a perfect resource, by any means, but you really only need to find one that works for you and for me.

5. You may be interested in the list of R Resources (free courses, books, tutorials and cheat sheets) [compiled by Paul van der Laken here](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/08/10/r-resources-cheatsheets-tutorials-books/) in August 2017.
