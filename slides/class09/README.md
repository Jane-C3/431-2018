## A Special Announcement for MS students in PQHS

If you are a student in the MS program in Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, you should have received an email yesterday from Lingpeng (Andrew) Shan, regarding the election of student representatives. 

- The plan is to elect 3-4 new student representatives at a meeting on Thursday 2018-09-27 at 4:15 PM. 
- If you are interested, fill out the form at https://goo.gl/forms/1HcbJMyo6ho4aPJl2 before Thursday at 3.
- If you want more information, please contact Andrew at `LXS503 at case dot edu`, or Dr. Mendel Singer. Thanks!

## Announcements

1. A reminder that [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework4) is due on Friday 2018-09-28 at noon. Please get it in on time. 
    - To generate the `iris1` tibble that you'll need for this Homework, you'll be creating a tibble (with `tbl_df`) of the existing `iris` data frame in R. Do not use `iris3`.
    
2. The [Homework 3 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework3) is now available. Homework 3 Grades should be posted Thursday.

3. Today, we will make use of a data set called `vonHippel-Lindau.csv` which is posted above, and on our [Data Page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data). Remember that if you want to download this .csv file, you should do so as a raw .csv.

4. Also, you'll be joining a Project Group containing 4-5 students. When we do that, you'll need to have one member of your group fill out the Google Form linked at http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-groups. 
    - If anyone is missing today, Dr. Love will assign them to one of the groups that winds up with only four people, so we wind up with 10 groups of 5 students each.

5. Coming soon:
    - Before Thursday 2018-09-27, you should read Leek *Elements of Data Analytic Style* Chapters 1-4 and 12.
    - By Tuesday 2018-10-02, you should read Silver *The Signal and the Noise* Chapters 4 (Weather predictions) and 5 (Earthquake predictions).
    - [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/quizzes) will be released to you next Friday 2018-10-05 and is due back at noon on Monday 2018-10-08 (Columbus Day).
    - The instructions for Homeworks 5 and 6 (due 2018-10-19 and 10-26, respectively) [are now posted](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework).

6. If you're looking for data to use in your project's Study 2, and you have identified a medical condition you are interested in studying, you might consider searching [datamed.org](https://datamed.org/), which aspires to be a sort of PubMed for data sets. 
    - There are more than 2.3 million data sets there, and while perhaps less than 1% are completely appropriate for our project, that's still a lot of relevant data to consider. It's not a perfect resource, by any means, but you really only need to find one that works for you and for me.

7. You may be interested in the list of R Resources (free courses, books, tutorials and cheat sheets) [compiled by Paul van der Laken](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/08/10/r-resources-cheatsheets-tutorials-books/) in August 2017.

8. One of the plot types I really don't care for is a [dynamite plot](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DynamitePlots). If you want to understand why these aren't a good idea, I encourage you to look at a thread from @T_Weissgerber, entitled "[Designing better figures for small studies: Why you shouldnâ€™t use bar graphs for continuous data and what to do instead](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1040576802979233793.html)" that one of you was good enough to pass along. 
    - There's a related "Perspective" piece from 2015 in *PLOS Biology* by Tracey Weissgerber and colleagues that you might be interested in, called [Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128). 
    - You might also like [Dynamite plots: unmitigated evil?](http://emdbolker.wikidot.com/blog:dynamite), some of which is drawn from [Vanderbilt's Wiki entry on Dynamite Plots](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DynamitePlots).
