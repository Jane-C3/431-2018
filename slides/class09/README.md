## Announcements

1. A reminder that [Homework 4](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework4) is due on Friday 2018-09-28 at noon. Please get it in on time. 

2. The [Homework 3 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework3) is now available. Homework 3 Grades should be posted Thursday.

3. Today, we will make use of a data set called `vonHippel-Lindau.csv` which is posted above, and on our [Data Page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data). Remember that if you want to download this .csv file, you should do so as a raw .csv.

4. Also, you'll be joining a Project Group containing 4-5 students. When we do that, you'll need to have one member of your group fill out the Google Form linked at http://bit.ly/431-2018-project-groups. 
    - If anyone is missing today, Dr. Love will assign them to one of the groups that winds up with only four people, so we wind up with 10 groups of 5 students each.

5. If you're looking for data to use in your project's Study 2, and you have a medical condition you are interested in studying, you might consider searching [datamed.org](https://datamed.org/), which aspires to be a sort of PubMed for data sets. 
    - There are more than 2.3 million data sets there, and while perhaps less than 1% are completely appropriate for our project, that's still a lot of relevant data to consider. It's not a perfect resource, by any means, but you really only need to find one that works for you and for me.

6. You may be interested in the list of R Resources (free courses, books, tutorials and cheat sheets) [compiled by Paul van der Laken](https://paulvanderlaken.com/2017/08/10/r-resources-cheatsheets-tutorials-books/) in August 2017.

7. One of the plots I really don't care for is what Jeff Leek calls a dynamite plot. If you want to understand why these aren't a good idea, I encourage you to look at a thread from @T_Weissgerber, entitled "[Designing better figures for small studies: Why you shouldnâ€™t use bar graphs for continuous data and what to do instead](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1040576802979233793.html)" that one of you was good enough to pass along. 
    - There's a related "Perspective" piece from 2015 in *PLOS Biology* by Tracey Weissgerber and colleagues that you might be interested in, called [Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128). 

## A Promotional Announcement

*Sweeney Todd* opens [this Friday evening 2018-09-29 at the Brecksville Theatre](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater), and runs for nine performances over three weekends. I play Judge Turpin.
